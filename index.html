	<h1>Mi amor <3</h1>


<p>
		As clich√©d as it sounds, you really do make my world go round! You make me laugh , you make me talk, you understand my obsession for random things; you make effort and take some time to talk  to me.
		</p>
	<p>
		It's just been two days since i talked to you. But,i feel like I've not talked for a while. Anyway..... when ever you call, it makes everything in this world beautiful again.
